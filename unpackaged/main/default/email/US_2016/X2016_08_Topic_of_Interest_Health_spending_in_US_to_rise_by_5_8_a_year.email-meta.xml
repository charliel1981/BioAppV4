    <textOnly>Dear  {!Contact.FirstName},
News for you...
Healthcare spending in the United States will likely grow by an average of 5.8 percent per year over the next decade, a bit faster than the past two years, due to an aging population, rising medical prices and faster economic growth, according to updated projections from the federal government.

The spending will represent 20.1 percent of the country&#39;s total economy by 2025, up from 17.5 percent in 2014. Total health expenditures this year are expected to reach $3.2 trillion, rising to $5.6 trillion in 2025.
