<BR />This data has been extracted from the Definitive Healthcare database. 
<BR />
<BR />It is Medicareâ€™s policy not to provide a claim count for procedures that have 10 or fewer patients.  For these procedures, the value of the claim total is provided, but not the number of patients who involved.

<BR />
<BR /><b>Est total payments</b>
<BR />This is the amount paid to the hospital after negotiated discounts have been applied. The charge submitted by the hospital to the payer is much higher.
<BR />
<BR /><b>Readmission rate</b>
<BR />This is based on Medicare data only and produced by CMS.
<BR /> 
<BR />The calculation is based on qualifying claims (there are a number of exclusions including: patients with an incomplete Medicare history, discharge takes place at the end of the period and any readmission would be in the next period etc).  
<BR />
<BR />A zero means there were no admissions (numerator=0).  A blank field means there are no qualifying claims (denominator=0).
<BR />

<BR />This is the average length of stay and is based on Medicare data only.
